# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

FootTraffic

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

An iOS app that tracks and groups users based on geographic location. It will then use this data to provide useful services -- (that still need to be worked out)

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The app will run on iOS iPhones. It will be designed to work on all iPhones. Users will be able to create an account which will be stored in a database. The
    passwords will be encrypted, but I need to research positives/negatives of encrypting both client and server-side. Users will store preferences for
    specific services in a geographic location. Then using location-tracking, the app will generate something similar to: "Hey, we saw you prefer "x, y, and z",
    why don't you try out "a, b, c" which are all nearby?". If the user isn't interested, this will be stored in the users profile for future reference so
    that they "a, b, and c" aren't recommended again. The goal is to use all of this data cross-examined against other user-data who are in similar geographic
    locations and have similar stored preferences.

## If planning to combine CS50's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to CS50, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

Not applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

No matter what, I'd like to complete the UI, login/logout, and location tracking aspect.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome would be to make a moderately sophisticated database structure for storing user accounts and information that they log.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome would be to link the user-inputted data, geographic location, and location-tracking to provide a useful service. Then learn about and
    hopefully implement something that would respond similarly to: "Person "X" has been provided service "Y" already, is this something that interests you too?"
    If so, "TODO".

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

1.) Learn Swift alongside Xcode
2.) Develop "storyboard" in Xcode
3.) Design a "first-stage" UI
4.) Generate a login + logout
5.) Learn more about encryption -- What methods are commonly used?
5.) Make a simple database structure for storing user info
6.) Learn about and implement location-tracking specific to iOS
7.) Decide what service will be provided and implement it
8.) Security may be a concern with location-tracking -- work on this
9.) Learn more about databases and design a more sophisticated DB that could scale with a large userbase
10.) Learn more about and improve the UI/UX to make the app more appealing
