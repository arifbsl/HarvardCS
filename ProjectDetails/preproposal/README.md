# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?


** IDEA 1: Post-CS50 Website/app **
- This idea will design a web-centric platform similar to the idea of Beyond CS50.
    The difference is that I want to design projects or "problem set-like" implemenations
    that will teach an advanced level of each programming language and framework we learned
    this semester. It would:
    1. Assess knowledge
    2. Have users perform additional projects/psets
    3. Display external resources

** IDEA 2: Location-based iOS app **
- I'm really interested in diving into Swift programming and implementing an app which
    is based around user-location. I have a fairly comprehensive idea of what I want to
    design after, but first I want to:
    1. Learn Swift and Xcode syntax (working knowledge)
    2. Design the front and back-end for a login and storing user-data
    3. Design the general "look and feel" for the app
    4. If I get this far, this is where I would start to design the actual application that
        the location-tracking will be used for

** IDEA 3: Web-app/standalone for processing and displaying genomic data **
- My day job involves wet-lab immunology research and one of the reasons I'm taking the course is
    to gain a working knowledge of how the bioinformaticians that my group collaborates with, performs
    their data analysis for us. This could be implemented primarily using Python, however, I know
    that the group uses R instead. My hope with this would be to ask questions other than what our
    bioinformatics collaborators are working on but with an entirely different application.
    The intention of this application would be to:
    1. Read raw genomic output (very large files (>TB))
    2. Store in a database
    3. Parse through the database looking for values that reach a threshold for user-specified
        parameters of user-specified genes
    4. Display an output and relationship



## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names, and who are their section leaders?

I do not plan to collaborate with anyone

## Do you have any questions of your own?

-I like all of these ideas somewhat equally. Ultimately, it would be great to have answered:
    1.) Is this idea too big or too small for the final project?
    2.) Can I add any large aspects to these ideas or remove aspects to fit the scope of the final project?

- I'm most excited about and interested in Idea 2, but I want to make sure I'm not biting off more than
    I can chew which is why I've only selected the beginning stages of this idea
    as my end goal.
