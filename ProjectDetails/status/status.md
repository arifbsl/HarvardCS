Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I started by learning Xcode and Swift basics. Then storyboarded the UI and have started working on that. Aside from that, I've explored some of the commonly used methods
for initializing user tracking. I've started to test some of these but ultimately want to develop my own strategy.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I haven't actually coded a large chunk of the project, due to the learning phase for Xcode and Swift. The process will accelerate dramatically this week now that I
understand the basics.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

Xcode was more time-consuming than I had anticipated as far as making the UI interact with the physical code. This took time but I have adjusted to the
software.
